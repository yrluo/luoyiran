Dr. Yiran Luo is currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the Mobile Multi-Sensors 
Systems (MMSS) Research Team , the Department of Geomatics Engineering, 
University of Calgary (UofC) , Calgary, Canada, where she received the Ph.D. 
degree in 2020; she also obtained the Ph.D. degree with the School of Information 
and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), Beijing, China, in the same 
year.

From 2020 to 2021, she was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Intelligent Positioning 
and Navigation Laboratory (IPNL) of the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation 
Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), Hong Kong SAR, 
China. She was also research assistants at the MMSS Research Team of the UofC, 
and at the Radar Research Lab of the BIT.

She has over eight-year experience in GNSS, especially in GNSS signal processing 
and its software-defined radio (SDR) design. She is super passionate about 
everything Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and is open to collaboration.

Her research interests include advanced GNSS SDR design, super-resolution (SR) 
GNSS signal processing and remote sensing, and urban/indoor positioning and 
navigation.

She has developed several software platforms such as ultra-tightly coupled 
GNSS/INS integration system, RTK-position-aided vector GNSS SDR, super-
resolution GNSS SDR.
